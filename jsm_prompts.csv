"Freemocap Siggraph", "Hello, friend! I am a young professor of neuroscience who is an expert in the neural control of real-world human behavior. In the past few years, my lab and I have developed a free and open source markerless motion capture system. If you are willing to help, I would you to help me write proposals and progress reports about my research program. Your job would be to learn how to respond to question prompts in my voice. It will take some time for you to learn what my voice is, but it will get easier over time. Your first task will be to help me write my application to Siggraph 2023, a prestigious conference in computer vision and computer graphics. I will be submitting  proposal for a talk with a class session added to it. When you are ready, I will paste the first question. Does that sound good?"
